# StarbucksAnalysis

This dataset is composed of a survey questions of over 100 respondents for their buying behavior at Starbucks. Income is show in Malaysian Ringgit (RM)

There are a few interesting columns including the ratings customers were asked to give (between 1 to 5) for many different aspects of the Starbucks experience such as price, ambiance, service, etc. Customers were also asked how likely they would be to choose Starbucks for business meetings or hanging out with friends ("choose rate").

I'm interested to see what parameters impact customer's choose rate.
